   libvirt Sandbox
   ===============

The libvirt-sandbox package provides an API for building application
sandboxes using libvirt. Sandboxes can be based on either container
or machine based virtualization technology. Also included is a simple
command line tool for launching sandboxes for arbitrary commands.

Installation
------------

The libvirt-sandbox package uses GNU autotools, so the build install
process follows the standard process documented in the INSTALL file.
As a quick start you can do

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc \
        --localstatedir=/var --libdir=/usr/lib
  make
  sudo make install

Or to install into a private user specific location

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/libvirt-sandbox
  make
  make install

The following mandatory dependancies are required in order to
build libvirt-sandbox

  libvirt-glib     >= 0.1.7
  libvirt          >= 1.0.2
  glib2            >= 2.28.0

And either the libvirt LXC or QEMU/KVM drivers.


Communication
-------------

To communicate with the development team, or to post patches
there is a technical mailing list:

   https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libvir-list

End user support can be found at

   https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libvirt-users

There is also a mailing list for new release announcements:

  https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libvirt-announce

Bugs found when using an OS distribution's binary packages should
be reported to the OS vendors' own bug tracker first.
